<div class="mainBody"> 
<p>The Hero's Journey, also known as the Monomyth, is the most classic of story architypes, and has it's roots in Ancient 
Greek myth. As such, stories that use this model often involve a character from a simple and familiar background undergoing
training and overcoming a great obstacle to become greater than they were before. There are many versions of this cycle, the
hero's journey is specifically accredited to Joseph Campbell for his book "The Hero with 1000 Faces", but has also been
adapted for use by Christopher Vogler, who wrote a more basic guide to using the hero's journey that would be used during 
his work with Disney and after. (This model is based on Christopher Voglers, as it is much more concise)</p>

<h4>The Ordinary World</h4>

<p><img src="CBImages/HJ01Icon.png" alt="An Icon for Stage 1 of the Diagram" class ="smallImage"> 
 The Starting point of the narrative, the hero is in their ordinary world and is shown interacting 
 with the people around him. We get a sense of their character and what they stand for, and a general 
 understanding of the status quo.</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="stageBody"> 

<h4>Call to Adventure</h4>

<p><img src="CBImages/HJ02Icon.png" alt="An Icon for Stage 1 of the Diagram" class ="smallImageAlt"> 
 The peace of this status quo is interrupted and the hero recieves is given their quest, a task or problem to
 resolve. This can be anything from a great otherworldly threat to a smaller more personal issue, and will 
 regardless serve as the main drive of the story.</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="stageBody"> 

<h4>Refusal of the Call</h4>

<p><img src="CBImages/HJ03Icon.png" alt="An Icon for Stage 1 of the Diagram" class ="smallImage"> 
 The Hero hesitates to take up the quest for some reason, either due to some personal shortcoming or 
 doubts as to the achievablity of this quest. They will refuse the call as a result, which will normally have
 some kind of concequence, perhaps giving more motivation to undertake the journey.</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="stageBody"> 

<h4>Meeting the Mentor</h4>

<p><img src="CBImages/HJ04Icon.png" alt="An Icon for Stage 1 of the Diagram" class ="smallImageAlt"> 
 A wise figure is introduced and meets the hero, offering them advice, training, spiritual guidence, an 
 item of value, something critical to making the hero undertake the journey. They overcome their hesitation 
 and begins preparing to take on this quest.</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="stageBody"> 

<h4>Crossing the Threshold</h4>

<p><img src="CBImages/HJ05Icon.png" alt="An Icon for Stage 1 of the Diagram" class ="smallImage">
 The Hero is now ready to undertake the quest set out before them, either accepting it and going willingly 
 or running out of time and being forced to undertake it. They leave the familiar world and step 
 into an unknown one for the first time.</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="stageBody"> 

<h4>Tests, Allies, Enemies</h4>

<p><img src="CBImages/HJ06Icon.png" alt="An Icon for Stage 1 of the Diagram" class ="smallImageAlt"> 
 Now that the quest is truely underway a new set of challenges present themselves as the hero progresses. 
 These will involve discerning between friend and foe, of which both may be in ample supply, and growing their
 skills with more direct challenges, overall preparing them for the greater obstacles ahead.
</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="stageBody"> 

<h4>Approach to the Inmost Cave</h4>

<p><img src="CBImages/HJ07Icon.png" alt="An Icon for Stage 1 of the Diagram" class ="smallImage"> 
 The build-up to the first true challenge of the quest, and a cause for any doubts or fears to resurface in the face of 
 the new and perhaps unfamiliar. This buildup is about them preparing to face such a challenge and coming
 to terms with any issues they might have with the quest or their abilities.
</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="stageBody"> 

<h4>Ordeal</h4>

<p><img src="CBImages/HJ08Icon.png" alt="An Icon for Stage 1 of the Diagram" class ="smallImageAlt"> 
 The challenge is now made real and the stakes are high, the hero must overcome this obstacle to ensure their quest
 continues and quite possibly that they survive at all. This will most likely be their most difficult challenge 
 to pass and will be the most important component of the story.
</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="stageBody">

 becoming a stronger person for doing so. The hero also usually obtains something, such as an item of importance 
 to their quest or some kind of emotional payoff.
</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="stageBody"> 

<h4>The Road Back</h4>

<p><img src="CBImages/HJ10Icon.png" alt="An Icon for Stage 1 of the Diagram" class ="smallImageAlt"> 
 Now that the quest is all but complete the journey home must be undertaken, either completing their goal if such
 hasn't already been completed or simply seeing through the literal journey home. However, there is still one final 
 challenge on the horizon they must face before completing their journey.
</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="stageBody"> 

<h4>Resurrection</h4>

<p><img src="CBImages/HJ11Icon.png" alt="An Icon for Stage 1 of the Diagram" class ="smallImage"> 
 The final challenge has presented itself and is now underway, with the highest stakes of the journey so far, normally
