<div class = "stageBody"> 
<p> I have always been an avid reader and a occasional writer, even from a young age. 
Mostly I read more modern books but I did have a period at around 14 years old where I delved into some more classic works, 
one of which was the odyssey, one of the oldest known stories. How something so ancient could be structured in such an 
approachable way was facinating to me, and after looking into it I gained two things: <br><br> One, an appreciation for the 
skill required to translate this works into a modern lanugage, and two, the knowledge of the monomyth, the first real story 
structure and what would become the basis for the hero's journey. <br><br> From there I learned more about this and other 
structures and how I could incorporate them into my own work, how they provide tried and true blueprints for excellent 
pacing and a foundation for gripping narratives as a result. That is why I chose this topic for the site and I hope that 
it was as interesting of a read as it was when I discovered the first of these structures years ago.</p>
