<h1>The Three Act Structure</h1>

<div class="mainBody"> 
<p>The Three Act Structure is a classical form of storytelling popularised by stage productions such as
plays and musicals, and now being found across all media. It is, more than any other storytelling model, a 
fundemental piece as often models will emulate the three act structure unintentionally, at least in part. 
The model as it exists today is primarily based on the work of Syd Field, but examples similar to this model 
can be found throughout history, such as William Shakespeare's five act plays.</p>

 <div class="stageBody"> <h2>ACT I: The Setup</h2> 
 <p>
  The first act primarily exists to establish the main characters and the setting. 
  In the first half this is the whole of it but in the second half the "inciting incident" occurs, 
  which starts the story proper. This escalates into the first major plot point, raising the "dramatic question" 
  that will drive the remainder of the story.

<div class="column"> 
 <div class="stageBody"> <h2>ACT II: The Confrontation</h2> 
 <p>
 The second act is concerned with the characters attemping to resolve the situation that has arisen as a result 
 of the inciting incident, but typically this situation will keep worsening as the protagonists lack the means 
 or understanding to reach this resolution (The Midpoint). The bulk of the narrative will be around their character arch leading
 into the second major plot point and the final act.
 </p> </a></div>

<div class="column"> 
 <div class="stageBody"> <h2>ACT III: The Resolution</h2> 
 <p>
 The third and final act is about the resolution of the problem, typically resolved during the climax of the story 
 towards the end of the act. It also shows the protagonists having grown from their experiences and become better 
 people as a result, and the proposed dramatic question is answered.
