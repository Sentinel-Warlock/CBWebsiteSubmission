<div class="mainBody"> 
<p>The Fichtean Curve is a more unorthodox method of storytelling that is concerned less with specific arcs and
instead builds itself around situations or key events that serve to regularly propel the plot forward. This makes
it much more suitable for episodic content, but it can still find a home in more long form storytelling too, such
as those written by the creator of the model John Gardner, the American author and professor.</p>

 <div class="column"> 
 <div class="stageBody"> <h2>The Crises</h2> 
 <p>
 The primary bulk of the curve is built from crises, and how the stakes escalate between them. Each crisis can
 introduce a new plot element, a sudden change or development, or just a new piece of information or skill given
 to the characters. This takes up around two-thirds of the narrative, leading into the climax.
 </p> </a></div>
</div>

<div class="column"> 
 <div class="stageBody"> <h2>The Climax</h2>
<p>
 The highest point of action and tension within the story, and the resolution of the crises that have come before it. 
 At this point the characters will have found a way to resolve the developing situation and may well have changed
 forever from their experiences. The tension then slides back down as the story and subplots are wrapped up.
